### Tasking Manager Database Schema

The TM database schema has evolved over the years. It is currently
implemented using sqlalchmey for the backend.

#### Misc Tables

* alembic_version - The version of alembic used
* banner - A list of banners, which doesn't appear to be used anywhere
* priority_areas - A list of geometries for priority areas
* release_version - The version of the TM release
* spatial_ref_sys - Postgis support

* 
* messages - Support messaging between users
* notifications - 

#### Prepopulated Tables

These tables contain data used by the frontend mostly. These could
have been an Enum, but a tables can be updated by the front end,
whereas an Enum can't. It does seem entirely possible these could be
extended by a project manager, for example, adding a new license.

* interests - General mapper interests
* licenses - Data licenses
* mapping_issue_categories - Issues with the map data
* application_keys - Application keys for remote data. This appears to
  not be used.

#### Campaign  Tables

The campaigns table is for mapping campaigns. A single campaign can
involve multiple organizations and TM projects. 

* campaigns - primary table
* campaign_organisations - utility table to relate organizations with
  a campaign
* campaign_projects - utility table to relate projects with a campaign
