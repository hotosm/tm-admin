# Managing Roles

Currently there are two sets of roles in Tasking Manage style
projects, users and teams, The team roles only apply to teams, a
users indivigual role is used for mapping.

While it would be possible to implement complex access rules for most
operations, I think a ladder approach is easiest. Operations just
require a certain minimal role level. For example, an assocate
project manager might be able to update a project profile, but not be
able to delete it. It is entirely possible that an associate project
mamager would be helping with managing mappers and team profiles as
well.

## Team Roles

The NOT Tasking Mannager (TM) has these team roles:

	- teamroles:
		- READ_ONLY
		- MAPPER
		- VALIDATOR
		- MANAGER

The HOT Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) doesn't quite have the
same concept as an OSM Team, as it uses OpenDataKit (ODK) instead of
OpenStreetMap (OSM). If a field mappers using FMTM are also in an OSM
Teams, they should be able to use OSM Teams from FMTM, but Teams
support in FMTM is not something on the roadmap. It is entirely likely
field mapper may want to form a team, whether they have an OSM account
or not. For now, FMTM doesm't need to add any additional roles. 

## User Roles

The NOT Tasking Mannager (TM) has these user roles:

	- userrole:
		- USER_READ_ONLY
		- MAPPER
		- ADMIN

The expanded set of roles used by the Field Mapping Tasking Manager
(FMTM) is:

	- userrole:
		- FIELD_ADMIN
		- ORGANIZATION_ADMIN
		- PROJECT_MANAGER
		- ASSOCIATE_MANAGER
		- VALIDATOR
		- SUPER_ADMIN
		- WEB_ADMIN

A difference here is FMTM has VALIDATOR as a user roles, where TM has
it as a team role. Other changes are the addition of multiple
administrative roles. Since roles aren't portsble across
projects, this czn be ignored. I'm not sure SUPER_ADMIN and
WEB_ADMIN are needed, it seems those access permissions would be
handled by postgres directly.

# Data Exchange

Since this project supports data exchange between projects, it's worth
nothing that roles *are not* portable across projects. Even witnin TM,
a project manager in one project only may be  mapper in another,
Especially for TM projects transferred to FMTM.

There are other limitations, for examplea, the ability to send and
receive data from other projects other than automated messages.
